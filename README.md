An application to show or hide 'hidden files' on macOS

I have created this using AppleScript, but it isn't perfected at all.

I am now unsure whether I should refine the AppleScript version, or redevelop it in Swift.

The AppleScript version is availible for you to use - just download the .app File (Folder) in the root of the master branch.
